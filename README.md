The platform consists of five core pages:

Home Page: Brief overview and navigation to other pages. The home page highlights the platform's purpose and provides quick links to its main features.

Login/Register Page: Secure sign-in and sign-up system verified by college email. This ensures only authorized users can access the platform.

Find a Friend Page: AI-powered tool to recommend connections based on shared interests, academic goals, and hobbies.

Confession Page: An anonymous space for students to express themselves freely. The page incorporates moderation features to maintain a positive environment.

Messaging Page: Real-time direct messaging system for personalized communication (under development).

Additionally, the website’s design and structure are focused on accessibility and responsiveness, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. The platform is built with scalability in mind, making it adaptable to future enhancements and larger user bases.
